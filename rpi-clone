VERSION=1.5
# Version 1.5	2016/09/09
#	* Remove any leading /dev/ from dest disk.
#	* Warn dest disk may be a partition if it ends with a digit.
# Version 1.4	2016/03/23
#	* Use -F on mkfs.ext4 and avoid the question.
# Version 1.3	2016/03/16
#	* don't > /dev/null for the mkfs.ext4 since mkfs can ask a question
# Version 1.2	2015/02/17
#	* add -x option
#	* tweak some echo messages
# Version 1.1	2015/02/16
#	* Do not include dphys swapfile in the clone.
#	* Add a missing -s flag to one of the parted commands.
#	* Dump parted stderr to /dev/null since it now complains about destination
#	    disk partitions ending outside of disk before I get chance to resize
#	    the partitions.
#	* Strip trailing s from PART_START - (fdisk now doesn't seem to accept...)
